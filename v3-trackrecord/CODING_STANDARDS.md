# Coding Standards & Style Guide

This document defines the coding conventions and project structure used in `v3-trackrecord`.

---

## 💻 Tech Stack
- React (Create React App)
- [Any libraries you use]

---

## 🧩 File & Folder Structure
- `components/` — Reusable UI components
- `pages/` — Top-level views/routes
- `utils/` — Helper functions
- `styles/` — Global or scoped CSS

---

## ✍️ Code Style
- Use **camelCase** for variable and function names
We follow consistent naming patterns for class and ID selectors to improve readability and maintainability:

### 🧷 Naming Convention
- Use **kebab-case** for Classes (all lowercase, hyphen-separated)
- Use **snake_case** for ID's (all lowercase, underscore-separated)
- Use **PascalCase** for component names
- Keep components small and single-responsibility
- `MyComponent.jsx`, not `mycomponent.js`
- CSS modules: `ComponentName.module.css`
- Constants: `THIS_IS_SAMPLE_CONSTANT`
- Variables: `camelCaseForLocalVariables`

## 🗂 Versioning Notes
This applies specifically to `v3-trackrecord`. For `v2`, refer to its own directory.
